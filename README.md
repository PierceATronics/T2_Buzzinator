T2 Buzzinator - Programmable Timed Buzzer

![](/Documents/Images/Programmable_Timed_Buzzer_PCB_3D_View.png)

The T2 Buzzinator is an adjustable timed buzzer circuit emitting noise from a magnetic transducer buzzer for a programmable duration of time. The buzz time duration is programmed simply by a potentiometer and swtich.  The T2 Buzzinator is built around two 555 Timer ICs and other discrete components.

This repo contains the KiCAD schematic and PCB design of the Buzzinator, as well as other supporting documents (Bill of Materials (BOM), LTSpice simulation, etc.)
